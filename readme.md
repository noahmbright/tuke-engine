# Vulkan Backend TODOs

## âœ… Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Implement texture loading and staging uploads
- [ ] Implement image layout transitions for textures
- [ ] Create image views and samplers for texture binding
- [ ] Integrate UV coordinates into vertex data pipeline
- [ ] Sample textures in fragment shaders to verify setup

## ðŸ”œ Near-Term Infrastructure
- [ ] Load models with positions, normals, UVs, and indices (e.g. OBJ or glTF)
- [ ] Implement a camera system with view and projection matrices
- [ ] Add basic input handling for camera movement (WASD + mouse)
- [ ] Ensure robust synchronization, frame submission, and swapchain recreation
- [ ] Implement basic directional lighting in shaders
- [ ] Optional: Implement shader hot reloading for faster iteration

## ðŸ’¡ Optional Enhancements (Future, as needed)
- [ ] Implement shadow mapping pipeline
- [ ] Add normal mapping support
- [ ] Implement PBR shading with IBL
- [ ] Create a scene graph or ECS if gameplay demands it
- [ ] Implement deferred rendering pipeline if forward rendering becomes limiting
- [ ] Implement GPU-driven culling or compute-based rendering for large scenes

## ðŸŽ¯ Creative Focus Unlock
- [ ] Prototype interesting shaders for visual effects
- [ ] Design interactive worlds with instancing and texture rendering
- [ ] Prototype gameplay mechanics leveraging existing rendering capabilities

# Principle
Build only what is required to unlock your immediate creative goals; refine abstractions and add infrastructure as project demands grow.
